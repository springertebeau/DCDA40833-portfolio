            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                I use AI daily. Something that I already do to help with my school work is ask it to format things, make my emails sound better, write me outlines, etc. I think that is an appropriate use because it is not cheating and I am not asking it to do my work for me. I think using it for emails will also help and be an appropriate use in my professional career.

            <h2>Tool 1: ChatGPT</h2>

            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>
                The first AI tool that I used for this lab was ChatGPT, which I use pretty much every day. Since I use this tool so much, I decided to ask it a few more personal questions. The first prompt I gave it was “Give me a short summary about myself from information I’ve given you before”. It had a very good sense of of my majors and skills. For the most part it had pulled from my resume and previous course work. I would say the output it gave me was half true.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second prompt I gave it to go off of the last one was “What would you say my greatest strength is?” The output it gave me was “your ability to bridge strategy and execution”. I would not particularly say this about myself. It did a good job at pulling examples of why it thought this, but it did not really make sense as a whole to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Something it did well was pulling from my resume to describe me and something it did not do well was exaggerate to the point where the fact was no longer true.
            </p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>
                I think the greatest use for AI would be to ask it to format things. That is where I have found the most success. I think a poor use case would be to ask it to write you a paper because it is easily recognizable as AI.
            </p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>
                Some concerns that arise from using this tool is that it mispells words a lot and is not always up to date to the day.

            <h2>Tool 2: Google Gemini</h2>

            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>
                The second AI tool that I used for this lab was Google Gemini. I have never used this tool before so I was intrigued to try it. The promt that I gave this tool was “What are the latest TikTok trends?” It gave me a short overview and then gave me five different trends and explained what each trend was and the background on it. The second prompt I gave it was “Give me a short summary of that”. It gave me five bullet points each with a very short sentense.
            </p>
            <p>
                Something I think this tool does well is give a lot of options and explanations. I feel like it maybe fell short where it was no 100% up to date.
            </p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>
                I think since this tool is from Google, a good use case would be to use it as a search browser. I think the worse use case would be to ask it to do school work.
            </p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>
                The only concern I have when using this is that it is very much like ChatGPT and I feel like it will not become as popular.

            <h2>Broader Reflections</h2>
            <p>
                I think AI tools will affect the skills taught in the DCDA program because AI can basically do most things we learn about like coding for example. I think creativity remains uniquely human in this program because AI does not have an out of the box perspective. When using a new AI tool, I think that it is necessary to research why it was made and what it can do differently from AI tools we already have.
