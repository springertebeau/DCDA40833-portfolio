    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates using AI to generate Python code for data analysis and visualization. The task is to analyze student study habits and their correlation with exam performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AI Prompt Used:\n",
    "> \"Create Python code that generates a sample dataset of 50 students with columns for study_hours (1-10), sleep_hours (4-9), and exam_score (0-100). Then create a scatter plot showing the relationship between study hours and exam scores, with points colored by sleep quality. Add a trend line and proper labels.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Level:\n",
    "- **Data Generation:** I understand how numpy.random is used to create realistic sample data\n",
    "- **Pandas DataFrame:** I understand this is a table-like data structure, similar to Excel\n",
    "- **Matplotlib:** I understand the basics of creating plots, but the advanced styling was AI-generated\n",
    "- **Statistical Correlation:** I know what it means but asked AI to calculate it"

    "## Reflection on AI-Assisted Coding\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Worked Well:\n",
    "- AI generated syntactically correct code on the first try\n",
    "- The visualization was professional-looking without me knowing advanced matplotlib\n",
    "- AI handled the statistical calculations (correlation) that I don't know how to do yet\n",
    "\n",
    "### What I Modified:\n",
    "- Reduced the random noise in exam scores from 20 to 15 to make the trend clearer\n",
    "- Added the second sleep hours visualization (initial AI prompt only included study hours)\n",
    "- Changed some color values to match my portfolio's color scheme\n",
    "\n",
    "### What I Learned:\n",
    "- How pandas DataFrames work and why they're useful for tabular data\n",
    "- The concept of correlation coefficients (though I still don't know the math)\n",
    "- How to create categorical variables from continuous data using pd.cut()\n",
    "- The importance of setting a random seed for reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "### Honest Assessment:\n",
    "I could NOT have written this code from scratch. However, I CAN now:\n",
    "- Read and understand what each section does\n",
    "- Modify the data inputs and labels\n",
    "- Troubleshoot basic errors (I had a typo in 'exam_score' that I fixed myself)\n",
    "- Explain to someone else what the code accomplishes and why it's structured this way\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI acted as a teacher by providing working examples I could learn from."
