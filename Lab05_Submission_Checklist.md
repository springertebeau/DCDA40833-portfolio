## Self-Assessment Questions

Before submitting, honestly answer these:

- [ ] **Know What You Know:** Can I separate what I understand from what I don't? Have I documented this honestly in comments?

- [ ] **The Explanation Test:** Could I explain my code to a classmate at my level and walk them through what it does and why?

- [ ] **Modification Honesty:** Did I actually change the AI's output? If I changed nothing, was the code genuinely perfect or did I not look closely enough?

- [ ] **Choosing Your Level:** Did I pick experiments that challenged me at my current skill level, or did I stay in my comfort zone?

- [ ] **Reflection Authenticity:** Is my reflection my own thinking, or did I write what I thought the instructor wanted to hear? Do my "personal guidelines" reflect how I'll actually behave?

- [ ] **Credit Clarity:** If a classmate read my portfolio page, would they understand exactly what AI contributed, what I contributed, and what I'm still figuring out?

## What NOT to Submit

❌ AI-generated reflection (instructor will know)  
❌ Code I don't understand  
❌ Undocumented/uncommented code  
❌ Code without attribution where AI was used  

---

## Before You Click Submit:

1. **Test the feature:** Visit your GitHub Pages site and test dark mode on:
   - Desktop browser
   - Mobile device
   - After refreshing the page (localStorage persistence)

2. **Verify all links work:**
   - Navigation links on all pages
   - Link to Jupyter notebook from lab05.html
   - GitHub Pages and repo links in submission

3. **Check for errors:**
   - Run the Jupyter notebook in Google Colab to ensure it executes without errors
   - Validate HTML (no broken tags)
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors

4. **Re-read reflection:**
   - Does it sound like me?
   - Is it honest about understanding gaps?
   - Does it demonstrate critical thinking?

5. **Convert .md to PDF:**
   - Open `Lab05_Reflection_Tebeau.md` in VS Code or text editor
   - Print to PDF or use a markdown-to-PDF converter
   - Check that formatting looks clean

## Optional Enhancements (Bonus Points?)

Consider adding these if time permits:

- [ ] Screenshot showing dark mode before/after comparison
- [ ] GIF demonstrating the toggle in action
- [ ] Additional visualizations in the Python notebook
- [ ] Accessibility testing notes (keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility)
- [ ] Performance metrics (how much localStorage is used, page load impact)

---

## Files Ready for Submission:

**Primary Files:**
- `Lab05_Reflection_Tebeau.pdf` (converted from .md)
- `lab05_data_viz.ipynb`
- `AI_Prompts_Log.txt` (create this with your original prompts)
- `AI_Original_Output.txt` (create this with before/after code examples)
- `Links.txt` with:
  - GitHub Pages URL
  - GitHub Repository URL

**In Repository (already pushed to GitHub):**
- `lab05.html`
- `index.html` (updated with Lab 5 link)
