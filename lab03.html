            <h2>Critique</h2>
            
            <h3>Information Resolution</h3>
            <p>
                The visualization clearly shows that the giant panda population is increasing, and the upward trend is easy to understand at a glance. The design is engaging and makes the message feel very positive. However, the graphic oversimplifies the story behind panda conservation. The supporting article explains differences between wild and captive pandas, where they live, and ongoing threats like climate change, but none of this information appears in the visual. Because of this, the graphic focuses more on being clear and appealing than on showing the full picture.
            </p>

            <h3>Effects Without Causes</h3>
            <p>
                The infographic shows that panda populations are increasing, but it does not explain what caused that change. The supporting article talks about government policies, habitat protection, and long-term conservation efforts, but these factors are not included in the visual. Because of this, viewers might assume the rebound happened on its own instead of understanding that it required intentional and ongoing human effort.
            </p>

            <h3>Overreaching and Rage to Conclude</h3>
            <p>
                The visualization also goes a bit too far by making panda conservation seem like a complete success. The positive tone and upward trend push viewers to quickly assume the problem is solved. This shows a bit of a rage to conclude, since the graphic does not encourage people to think about the remaining risks or the ongoing conservation work that the article explains is still needed.
            </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
               Overall, the “Giant Pandas Are Rebounding” infographic does a good job telling a positive story, but it is limited when it comes to deeper analysis. Using Tufte’s ideas, the graphic has low information resolution and focuses more on the outcome than the causes or uncertainties behind it. The visualization works well as an introduction to the topic, but the supporting article is needed to fully understand the challenges and efforts involved in panda conservation.
