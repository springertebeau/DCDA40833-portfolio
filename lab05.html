            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This lab explores "vibe coding" - using AI as a coding collaborator to generate, debug, and enhance code. The key principle: <strong>I must be able to read, explain, and modify any code I use</strong>, regardless of who (or what) wrote it.</p>
            
            <p>I completed two experiments to explore different points on the AI coding spectrum:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Experiment A:</strong> Portfolio Enhancement - Dark Mode Toggle</li>
                <li><strong>Experiment B:</strong> Python Data Visualization in Google Colab</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Experiment A Section -->
        <section id="experiment-a">
            <h2>Experiment A: Dark Mode Toggle</h2>
            
            <h3>What I Built</h3>
            <p>I added a dark mode toggle button to my portfolio that allows visitors to switch between light and dark themes. The feature includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A toggle button with moon/sun icons in the navigation bar</li>
                <li>CSS custom properties (variables) that change colors throughout the site</li>
                <li>JavaScript that saves the user's preference in browser localStorage</li>
                <li>Smooth transitions when switching between modes</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="framework-callout">
                <h3> Demo</h3>
                <p><strong>Try it now!</strong> Click the dark mode toggle button in the navigation bar at the top of this page to see the theme change. Your preference will be saved for your next visit.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p><strong>Understanding Level:</strong> I understand the logic and can explain it in my own words.</p>
            
            <p>The dark mode feature works through three main components:</p>
            
            <h4>1. CSS Variables (styles.css)</h4>
            <p><!-- AI-Generated: The color scheme --> I asked AI to create a dark mode color palette that maintains good contrast and keeps my pink theme. The code uses CSS custom properties (variables prefixed with <code>--</code>) that define colors for the entire site:</p>
            
            <pre><code>/* Light mode colors in :root */
:root {
    --text-color: #333;
    --bg-color: #f4f4f4;
    --card-bg: #ffffff;
}

/* Dark mode overrides */
body.dark-mode {
    --text-color: #e5e5e5;
    --bg-color: #1a1a1a;
    --card-bg: #2d2d2d;
}</code></pre>

            <p><strong>How this works:</strong> When the <code>dark-mode</code> class is added to the body element, all the color variables get new values. Since the rest of the CSS uses these variables (like <code>color: var(--text-color);</code>), the entire site changes instantly. I understand this concept fully - it's like find-and-replace but for colors.</p>

            <h4>2. Toggle Button (HTML)</h4>
            <p><!-- AI-Generated: Button structure with icons --> The toggle button uses Unicode emoji icons (for dark mode off, for dark mode on). I modified the AI's original positioning to make it work better on mobile devices.</p>

            <h4>3. JavaScript Functionality</h4>
            <p><!-- AI-Generated: localStorage logic --> The JavaScript handles three things:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Checking saved preference:</strong> When the page loads, it checks <code>localStorage</code> to see if the user previously enabled dark mode</li>
                <li><strong>Toggling the class:</strong> When clicked, it adds or removes the <code>dark-mode</code> class from the body</li>
                <li><strong>Saving preference:</strong> It stores the choice in <code>localStorage</code> so it persists between visits</li>
            </ol>

            <pre><code>// Check if dark mode was previously enabled
if (localStorage.getItem('darkMode') === 'enabled') {
    body.classList.add('dark-mode');
    icon.textContent = '☀️';
}

// Toggle on click and save preference
darkModeToggle.addEventListener('click', () => {
    body.classList.toggle('dark-mode');
    // Update icon and save to localStorage...
});</code></pre>

            <p><strong>My understanding:</strong> I understand how <code>localStorage</code> works - it's browser storage that persists data between sessions. I understand event listeners and how <code>classList.toggle()</code> adds/removes classes. The part I couldn't have written from scratch is the proper syntax for localStorage, but I could modify it or explain it to someone else.</p>

            <h3>What I Modified</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Changed the toggle button's padding from <code>0.3rem</code> to <code>0.5rem 1rem</code> to make it easier to tap on mobile</li>
                <li>Adjusted some dark mode colors - AI's original dark background was too dark (<code>#0a0a0a</code>), so I lightened it to <code>#1a1a1a</code></li>
                <li>Added more CSS variables beyond what AI initially created to ensure all page elements support dark mode (tables, borders, etc.)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Testing & Refinement</h3>
            <p>I tested by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clicking the toggle multiple times to verify smooth transitions</li>
                <li>Refreshing the page to confirm localStorage persistence</li>
                <li>Checking all pages in my portfolio to ensure consistent behavior</li>
                <li>Testing on mobile to verify touch-friendly button size</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Bug I found:</strong> Initially, the sun icon didn't show on page load even when dark mode was active. I fixed this by ensuring the icon update happens in the localStorage check, not just in the click handler.</p>

        <!-- Experiment B Section -->
        <section id="experiment-b">
            <h2>Experiment B: Python Data Visualization</h2>
            
            <h3>What I Built</h3>
            <p>I used AI to generate a Python notebook that creates and visualizes sample student performance data. The code generates 50 fictional students with study hours, sleep hours, and exam scores, then creates scatter plots to analyze correlations.</p>

            <div class="framework-callout">
                <h3>📊 View the Notebook</h3>
                <p><strong><a href="lab05_data_viz.ipynb" style="color: var(--primary-color);">Download Jupyter Notebook (lab05_data_viz.ipynb)</a></strong></p>
                <p>To run this notebook:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Upload to <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/" style="color: var(--primary-color);">Google Colab</a></li>
                    <li>Run all cells (Runtime → Run all)</li>
                    <li>The visualizations will appear inline</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h3>My AI Prompt</h3>
            <div style="background: #f0f0f0; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid var(--primary-color); margin: 1rem 0;">
                <p style="margin: 0;"><em>"Create Python code that generates a sample dataset of 50 students with columns for study_hours (1-10), sleep_hours (4-9), and exam_score (0-100). Then create a scatter plot showing the relationship between study hours and exam scores, with points colored by sleep quality. Add a trend line and proper labels."</em></p>
            </div>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p><strong>Understanding Spectrum:</strong> I understand the logic, but there are parts I couldn't write from scratch.</p>

            <h4>Parts I Fully Understand:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Generation:</strong> Using <code>np.random.randint()</code> to create random integers within a range</li>
                <li><strong>DataFrames:</strong> Like an Excel spreadsheet in Python - rows are students, columns are variables</li>
                <li><strong>Basic Plotting:</strong> <code>plt.scatter()</code> creates a scatter plot with x and y coordinates</li>
                <li><strong>Setting seed:</strong> <code>np.random.seed(42)</code> makes random numbers reproducible</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Parts I Understand Conceptually (but not implementation):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Correlation coefficient:</strong> I know it measures how strongly two variables are related (values between -1 and 1), but I don't know the mathematical formula</li>
                <li><strong>Trend line:</strong> <code>np.polyfit()</code> creates a line of best fit - I know what this is visually, but the polynomial fitting algorithm is a black box to me</li>
                <li><strong>pd.cut():</strong> This bins continuous data into categories - I understand the concept but wouldn't have known this function existed</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>What the Code Does (In My Own Words):</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Creates 50 fake students with random study hours (1-10) and sleep hours (4-9)</li>
                <li>Calculates exam scores using a formula: more study hours and more sleep = higher scores, plus some randomness to make it realistic</li>
                <li>Groups students into "Low", "Medium", and "High" sleep quality categories</li>
                <li>Creates a scatter plot where each point is a student, colored by their sleep quality</li>
                <li>Adds a red dashed trend line showing the overall pattern</li>
                <li>Calculates and displays a correlation coefficient (mine was 0.76, a strong positive relationship)</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>What I Modified</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Random noise:</strong> AI used <code>np.random.uniform(0, 20)</code>, but this made the correlation too weak. I changed it to <code>(0, 15)</code> to reduce randomness and make the pattern clearer</li>
                <li><strong>Second visualization:</strong> The original prompt only analyzed study hours. I asked AI to generate a second plot for sleep hours vs exam scores to compare correlations</li>
                <li><strong>Color scheme:</strong> Changed scatter plot colors to match my portfolio's pink/gold theme</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Study-Performance Correlation:</strong> 0.76 (strong positive) - more study hours strongly predict higher exam scores</li>
                <li><strong>Sleep-Performance Correlation:</strong> 0.65 (moderate positive) - adequate sleep also matters, but slightly less than study time in this synthetic data</li>
                <li><strong>Visual Pattern:</strong> Students with high sleep quality (green dots) tend to cluster toward the top of the chart</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Honest Assessment</h3>
            <p>Could I have written this from scratch? <strong>No.</strong> I don't know enough Python yet.</p>
            <p>Can I now:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>✅ Read and understand what each section does</li>
                <li>✅ Modify the data inputs and parameters</li>
                <li>✅ Explain to someone else what the code accomplishes</li>
                <li>✅ Fix basic errors (I corrected a typo in 'exam_score' myself)</li>
                <li>✅ Generate similar code with AI assistance for a different dataset</li>
                <li>❌ Write matplotlib styling code from memory</li>
                <li>❌ Implement statistical functions like correlation without AI/library help</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="process">
            <h2>Process & Critical Reflection</h2>

            <h3>When AI Was Helpful</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Syntax assistance:</strong> AI knew the exact CSS and JavaScript syntax I needed, saving hours of documentation searching</li>
                <li><strong>Professional output:</strong> The visualizations looked polished without needing to learn advanced matplotlib styling</li>
                <li><strong>Rapid prototyping:</strong> I could test the dark mode concept quickly and decide if I wanted to keep it</li>
                <li><strong>Learning through examples:</strong> Reading AI-generated code taught me patterns I can now recognize and reuse</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>When AI Was Problematic</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Over-confidence:</strong> It's easy to accept AI code without questioning if it's the best approach</li>
                <li><strong>Hidden complexity:</strong> Some solutions worked but were overly complex for what I needed</li>
                <li><strong>Testing required:</strong> AI doesn't catch all edge cases - I still had to test thoroughly</li>
                <li><strong>Knowledge gaps:</strong> I realized I don't deeply understand statistical calculations, just their outputs</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>My Role in AI-Assisted Workflow</h3>
            <p>What remains uniquely human:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vision & Goals:</strong> AI can't decide what feature to build - I chose dark mode because I wanted to improve user experience</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> I had to read every line of code and decide if it made sense</li>
                <li><strong>Integration:</strong> AI generates isolated snippets - I integrated them into my existing portfolio structure</li>
                <li><strong>Refinement:</strong> AI gave me a starting point, but I adjusted colors, sizes, and behavior based on testing</li>
                <li><strong>Critical Judgment:</strong> Knowing when to trust AI vs when to verify or modify its output</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Learning Trade-offs</h3>
            <p><strong>Does vibe coding help or hinder learning?</strong> Both, depending on how you use it.</p>
            
            <p><strong>It helps when:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>You read and analyze the generated code instead of blindly copying it</li>
                <li>You use it to learn patterns you can apply independently later</li>
                <li>You modify and experiment with the output to deepen understanding</li>
                <li>You're working slightly above your current skill level (productive struggle)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>It hinders when:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>You skip foundational learning and jump straight to AI generation</li>
                <li>You accept code you don't understand "because it works"</li>
                <li>You become dependent on AI for tasks you should be able to do independently</li>
                <li>You stop pushing yourself to understand the "how" and only care about the "what"</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>My experience:</strong> I found it helpful for this lab because I already understand HTML/CSS fundamentals from earlier labs. The AI helped me learn <em>advanced</em> techniques (CSS variables, localStorage) that would have taken much longer to learn through trial and error. However, for Python, I realized I need more foundational practice before vibe coding - I'm relying too heavily on AI for basic syntax.</p>

        <!-- Guidelines Section -->
        <section id="guidelines">
            <h2>My Personal AI Coding Guidelines</h2>
            
            <p>After this lab, I'm establishing these rules for myself:</p>

            <div class="framework-callout">
                <h3>✅ When I WILL Use AI</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learning new syntax in languages I already understand conceptually</li>
                    <li>Getting starter code for patterns I haven't implemented before</li>
                    <li>Debugging errors when I'm stuck after trying to solve them myself</li>
                    <li>Generating boilerplate code that follows standard patterns</li>
                    <li>Exploring "what's possible" before committing time to build something</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="framework-callout">
                <h3>⛔ When I WON'T Use AI</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>For assignments explicitly designed to test my understanding</li>
                    <li>When learning fundamental concepts for the first time</li>
                    <li>For code that I can't read and explain to someone else</li>
                    <li>When it would prevent me from practicing skills I need to develop</li>
                    <li>For reflections, analysis, or creative thinking (like this section!)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="framework-callout">
                <h3>📋 My Mandatory Practices</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Read everything:</strong> No code goes into my project without me reading every line</li>
                    <li><strong>The explanation test:</strong> If I can't explain it to a peer, I don't use it yet</li>
                    <li><strong>Comment honestly:</strong> Document what I understand vs what I don't (using the Understanding Spectrum)</li>
                    <li><strong>Attribute clearly:</strong> Mark AI-generated code and note what I modified</li>
                    <li><strong>Test thoroughly:</strong> AI output might work in ideal conditions but fail in edge cases</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Attribution & Citation</h3>
            <p><strong>Academic context:</strong> In coursework, I'll use inline comments to mark AI-generated code and document my understanding level (as I did in this lab).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Professional context:</strong> I would disclose AI usage in code reviews and documentation, especially for critical systems. However, I recognize that as AI becomes standard tooling (like Stack Overflow or autocomplete), the line will blur between "AI-assisted" and "normal programming."</p>

            <p><strong>Key principle:</strong> Attribution matters most when the AI does intellectual work I'm claiming credit for. If I use AI the way I'd use a reference book - to look up syntax or patterns I then integrate myself - attribution is less critical than ensuring correctness.</p>

            <h2>AI Prompts Used</h2>
            <p>Below are the key prompts I used to guide AI in generating code for both experiments.</p>

            <h3>Experiment A: Dark Mode Toggle Prompts</h3>
            
            <div class="framework-callout">
                <h4>Prompt 1: Initial Research</h4>
                <p><em>"How do I add a dark mode toggle to my website using CSS and JavaScript?"</em></p>
                <p><strong>AI Response:</strong> Suggested using CSS custom properties (variables) with a toggle class on the body element, plus JavaScript to switch between modes.</p>

            <div class="framework-callout">
                <h4>Prompt 3: Toggle Button</h4>
                <p><em>"Create a moon/sun toggle button for dark mode that sits in the navigation bar using CSS positioned absolutely to the right"</em></p>
                <p><strong>What I modified:</strong> Increased padding from 0.3rem to 0.5rem 1rem for better mobile usability.</p>
            </div>

                <p><em>"Write JavaScript that toggles dark mode on button click, changes the icon between moon and sun, and saves the preference in localStorage"</em></p>
                <p><strong>Bug I found:</strong> Icon didn't update on page load when dark mode was already enabled. Fixed by moving icon update inside the localStorage check.</p>

Then create a scatter plot showing the relationship between study hours and exam scores, with points colored by sleep quality. Add a trend line and proper labels."</em></p>
                <p><strong>Understanding Level:</strong> I understand the overall structure and data flow. Modified the random noise parameter to make correlation clearer.</p>

            <div class="framework-callout">
                <h4>Learning Prompts</h4>
                <p><em>"What's the difference between localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies in web development?"</em></p>
                <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> localStorage persists indefinitely (best for dark mode preference), sessionStorage clears on tab close, cookies have expiration dates and smaller storage.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="framework-callout">

        <!-- Code Modifications Section -->
        <section id="modifications">
            <h2>Code Modifications: Before & After</h2>
            <p>This section shows AI's original output and the changes I made.</p>

            <h3>Modification 1: CSS Dark Mode Variables</h3>
            
            <h4>AI's Original Output:</h4>
            <pre><code>:root {
    --primary-color: #f4a6c8;
    --bg-color: #f4f4f4;
    --text-color: #333;
}

body.dark-mode {
    --bg-color: #0a0a0a;
    --text-color: #e5e5e5;
}</code></pre>

            <h4>What I Changed:</h4>
            <pre><code>:root {
    --primary-color: #f4a6c8;
    --bg-color: #f4f4f4;
    --text-color: #333;
    --card-bg: #ffffff;        /* ADDED */
    --section-bg: #ffffff;     /* ADDED */
    --border-color: #e2e8f0;   /* ADDED */
}

body.dark-mode {
    --bg-color: #1a1a1a;       /* LIGHTENED from #0a0a0a */
    --text-color: #e5e5e5;
    --card-bg: #2d2d2d;        /* ADDED */
    --section-bg: #2d2d2d;     /* ADDED */
    --border-color: #404040;   /* ADDED */
}</code></pre>

            <p><strong>Why:</strong> Extended dark mode support to all page elements (cards, tables, borders) and lightened the background because pure black was too harsh.</p>

            <h3>Modification 2: Toggle Button Sizing</h3>
            
            <h4>AI's Original:</h4>
            <pre><code>.dark-mode-toggle {
    padding: 0.3rem;
    /* ... other styles ... */
}</code></pre>

            <h4>My Version:</h4>
            <pre><code>.dark-mode-toggle {
    padding: 0.5rem 1rem;      /* Increased for mobile touch targets */
    display: flex;              /* ADDED for better centering */
    align-items: center;        /* ADDED */
    gap: 0.5rem;               /* ADDED for icon spacing */
    /* ... other styles ... */
}</code></pre>

            <p><strong>Why:</strong> Original button was too small for mobile users. Increased padding to meet iOS minimum touch target size (44x44px) and added flexbox for better layout.</p>

            <h3>Modification 3: Python Data Generation</h3>
            
            <h4>AI's Original:</h4>
            <pre><code>data['exam_score'] = (
    50 +
    (data['study_hours'] * 3) +
    (data['sleep_hours'] * 2) +
    np.random.uniform(0, 20, n_students)  # Original: 0-20 range
)</code></pre>

            <h4>My Version:</h4>
            <pre><code>data['exam_score'] = (
    50 +
    (data['study_hours'] * 3) +
    (data['sleep_hours'] * 2) +
    np.random.uniform(0, 15, n_students)  # Changed: 0-15 range
)</code></pre>

            <p><strong>Why:</strong> Random noise of 0-20 made correlation too weak (r=0.52). Reducing to 0-15 produced clearer demonstration of the relationship (r=0.76) while maintaining realistic variation.</p>

            <h3>What I Didn't Change</h3>
            <p>I left AI's trend line code unchanged:</p>
            <pre><code>z = np.polyfit(df['study_hours'], df['exam_score'], 1)
p = np.poly1d(z)
plt.plot(df['study_hours'], p(df['study_hours']), "r--")</code></pre>

            <p><strong>Why:</strong> It works correctly and I understand what it does conceptually (creates line of best fit), but I don't know the polynomial fitting algorithm well enough to improve it. This is honest self-assessment - I use this code but acknowledge I couldn't write it from scratch yet.</p>

            <div class="framework-callout">
                <h3>Summary of Modifications</h3>
                <p><strong>Types of changes I made:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Usability improvements (button sizing for mobile)</li>
                    <li>Visual consistency (colors matching portfolio theme)</li>

        <section id="takeaways">
            <h2>Key Takeaways & Conclusion</h2>
            
            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>AI as a Learning Tool:</strong> Reading AI-generated code taught me patterns (CSS variables, localStorage) that I can now apply independently</li>
                <li><strong>Importance of Understanding:</strong> I can't maintain or debug code I don't understand, regardless of whether it "works"</li>
                <li><strong>Strategic AI Use:</strong> AI is most helpful when I already have foundational knowledge to evaluate its output</li>
                <li><strong>Honest Self-Assessment:</strong> Admitting knowledge gaps (like not understanding polynomial fitting algorithms) is more valuable than pretending mastery</li>
                <li><strong>Testing & Iteration:</strong> AI gives starting points, but refining through testing transforms code from "working" to "understood"</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>My AI Coding Philosophy</h3>
            <div class="framework-callout">
                <p><strong>Core Principle:</strong> I will use AI to accelerate learning and implementation, but maintain accountability for all code I submit. If I can't explain it, debug it, and modify it, I'm not ready to use it.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The measure of success:</strong> Can I do progressively more without AI over time, or am I becoming more dependent? If AI usage today helps me learn patterns I can apply independently tomorrow, it's helping. If I'm generating the same types of code with AI six months from now, it's hindering.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Addressing the Lab Objectives</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>✅ <strong>Understanding the AI Coding Spectrum:</strong> Experienced both "Collaborative" (dark mode) and "Vibe Coding" (Python) approaches</li>
                <li>✅ <strong>Critical Evaluation:</strong> Identified when AI helped (syntax, prototyping) and when it was problematic (black boxes, over-confidence)</li>
                <li>✅ <strong>Technical Skills:</strong> Learned CSS custom properties, localStorage, pandas/matplotlib basics</li>
                <li>✅ <strong>Documentation & Attribution:</strong> Used Understanding Spectrum comments, marked AI-generated sections, documented modifications</li>
                <li>✅ <strong>Ethical Reflection:</strong> Developed personal guidelines for responsible AI usage in coding</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Final Reflection</h3>
            <p>This lab taught me that AI-assisted coding exists on a spectrum, and where I position myself on that spectrum affects both my productivity and my learning. The key insight: <strong>AI is a tool for collaboration, not a replacement for understanding.</strong></p>
            
            <p>My role remains critical: defining problems, evaluating solutions, integrating code, ensuring quality, and most importantly, maintaining the ability to understand and explain any code I use. The question isn't "Should I use AI?" but "How do I use AI responsibly and effectively while continuing to grow as a programmer?"</p>

            <p><strong>Going forward:</strong> I'll use AI strategically to accelerate learning and implementation, while maintaining vigilance about dependence and ensuring I'm building skills rather than outsourcing thinking.</p>
