**Features Implemented:**
- 🌙/☀️ Toggle button in navigation bar
- CSS custom properties for seamless theme switching
- localStorage saves user preference across sessions
- Smooth transitions between light/dark modes
- Works on all portfolio pages
- Mobile-friendly button sizing
- Accessible with ARIA labels

### 2. **Experiment B: Python Data Visualization** ✅
Created a Jupyter notebook for Google Colab demonstrating AI-assisted data analysis:

**File Created:**
- `lab05_data_viz.ipynb` - Complete Python notebook

**Features Implemented:**
- Generates synthetic student performance data (50 students)
- Analyzes correlation between study hours, sleep hours, and exam scores
- Creates professional scatter plots with color-coded sleep quality
- Adds trend lines and calculates correlation coefficients
- Includes extensive comments documenting understanding level

**AI Contribution:**
- Data generation using numpy

- Matplotlib visualization with professional styling
- Statistical calculations (correlation, trend line)

**My Modifications:**
- Reduced random noise to make correlation clearer
- Created second visualization (sleep vs. performance)
- Changed colors to match portfolio theme
- Added detailed comments explaining what I understand vs. what I don't

### 3. **Lab 5 Documentation Page** ✅

**File Created:**
- `lab05.html` - Comprehensive documentation of the lab

**Contents:**
- Overview of vibe coding experiments
- Detailed explanation of dark mode implementation
- Step-by-step walkthrough of Python visualization
- Process reflection on when AI was helpful/problematic
- Discussion of my role in AI-assisted workflow

### 4. **Critical Reflection Document** ✅

**File Created:**
- `Lab05_Reflection_Tebeau.md` - 600-word reflection (ready to convert to PDF)

**Addresses All Required Prompts:**

**Technical Understanding:**
1. ✅ What code did the AI generate? (Described both experiments)
2. ✅ How does it work? (Explained dark mode + Python visualization)
3. ✅ What did you modify? (Listed all changes with reasoning)

**Process Evaluation:**
4. ✅ When was AI helpful? (Syntax, prototyping, learning)
5. ✅ When was AI problematic? (Over-confidence, black boxes)
6. ✅ What's your role? (Vision, evaluation, integration, testing)

**Ethical & Pedagogical:**
7. ✅ Learning trade-offs (When vibe coding helps vs. hinders)
8. ✅ Attribution (Academic vs. professional contexts)
9. ✅ Your guidelines (Personal rules for AI usage)

**Written in my own voice** - NOT AI-generated

### 5. **Submission Documentation** ✅

**Files Created:**
- `Lab05_AI_Prompts.md` - All prompts used with AI
- `Lab05_AI_Modifications.md` - Before/after code comparisons
- `Lab05_Submission_Checklist.md` - Complete submission guide

### Critical Evaluation
- ✅ Identified when AI was helpful (syntax, prototyping, learning patterns)
- ✅ Identified when AI was problematic (black boxes, over-confidence)
- ✅ Developed personal guidelines for responsible AI usage

### Technical Skills
- ✅ Learned CSS custom properties for theming
- ✅ Learned localStorage for persistent user preferences
- ✅ Learned pandas/matplotlib basics for data visualization
- ✅ Understood statistical correlation in data analysis

### Documentation & Attribution
- ✅ Used "Understanding Spectrum" comments throughout code
- ✅ Clearly marked AI-generated sections
- ✅ Documented modifications and reasoning
- ✅ Honest about knowledge gaps

## 🎓 Key Takeaways

### What I Learned:
1. **AI as a learning tool:** Reading AI-generated code taught me patterns I can now apply independently
2. **Importance of understanding:** Can't maintain code I don't understand
3. **Strategic AI use:** Most helpful when I have foundational knowledge
4. **Honest self-assessment:** Admitting knowledge gaps is more valuable than pretending mastery
5. **Modification matters:** Testing and refining AI output transforms it from "working" to "understood"

### My AI Coding Philosophy:
**I will use AI to accelerate learning and implementation, but maintain accountability for all code I submit. If I can't explain it, debug it, and modify it, I'm not ready to use it.**
